-- | TCP implementation of the transport layer.
--
-- The TCP implementation guarantees that only a single TCP connection (socket)
-- will be used between endpoints, provided that the addresses specified are
-- canonical. If /A/ connects to /B/ and reports its address as
-- @192.168.0.1:8080@ and /B/ subsequently connects tries to connect to /A/ as
-- @client1.local:http-alt@ then the transport layer will not realize that the
-- TCP connection can be reused.
--
-- Applications that use the TCP transport should use
-- 'Network.Socket.withSocketsDo' in their main function for Windows
-- compatibility (see "Network.Socket").

-- $design
--
-- [Goals]
--
-- The TCP transport maps multiple logical connections between /A/ and /B/ (in
-- either direction) to a single TCP connection:
--
-- > +-------+                          +-------+
-- > | A     |==========================| B     |
-- > |       |>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~\   |
-- > |   Q   |>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~Q   |
-- > |   \~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<|       |
-- > |       |==========================|       |
-- > +-------+                          +-------+
--
-- Ignoring the complications detailed below, the TCP connection is set up is
-- when the first lightweight connection is created (in either direction), and
-- torn down when the last lightweight connection (in either direction) is
-- closed.
--
-- [Connecting]
--
-- Let /A/, /B/ be two endpoints without any connections. When /A/ wants to
-- connect to /B/, it locally records that it is trying to connect to /B/ and
-- sends a request to /B/. As part of the request /A/ sends its own endpoint
-- address to /B/ (so that /B/ can reuse the connection in the other direction).
--
-- When /B/ receives the connection request it first checks if it did not
-- already initiate a connection request to /A/. If not it will acknowledge the
-- connection request by sending 'ConnectionRequestAccepted' to /A/ and record
-- that it has a TCP connection to /A/.
--
-- The tricky case arises when /A/ sends a connection request to /B/ and /B/
-- finds that it had already sent a connection request to /A/. In this case /B/
-- will accept the connection request from /A/ if /A/s endpoint address is
-- smaller (lexicographically) than /B/s, and reject it otherwise. If it rejects
-- it, it sends a 'ConnectionRequestCrossed' message to /A/. The
-- lexicographical ordering is an arbitrary but convenient way to break the
-- tie. If a connection exists between /A/ and /B/ when /B/ rejects the request,
-- /B/ will probe the connection to make sure it is healthy. If /A/ does not
-- answer timely to the probe, /B/ will discard the connection.
--
-- When it receives a 'ConnectionRequestCrossed' message the /A/ thread that
-- initiated the request just needs to wait until the /A/ thread that is dealing
-- with /B/'s connection request completes, unless there is a network failure.
-- If there is a network failure, the initiator thread would timeout and return
-- an error.
--
-- [Disconnecting]
--
-- The TCP connection is created as soon as the first logical connection from
-- /A/ to /B/ (or /B/ to /A/) is established. At this point a thread (@#@) is
-- spawned that listens for incoming connections from /B/:
--
-- > +-------+                          +-------+
-- > | A     |==========================| B     |
-- > |       |>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~\   |
-- > |       |                          |   Q   |
-- > |      #|                          |       |
-- > |       |==========================|       |
-- > +-------+                          +-------+
--
-- The question is when the TCP connection can be closed again.  Conceptually,
-- we want to do reference counting: when there are no logical connections left
-- between /A/ and /B/ we want to close the socket (possibly after some
-- timeout).
--
-- However, /A/ and /B/ need to agree that the refcount has reached zero.  It
-- might happen that /B/ sends a connection request over the existing socket at
-- the same time that /A/ closes its logical connection to /B/ and closes the
-- socket. This will cause a failure in /B/ (which will have to retry) which is
-- not caused by a network failure, which is unfortunate. (Note that the
-- connection request from /B/ might succeed even if /A/ closes the socket.)
--
-- Instead, when /A/ is ready to close the socket it sends a 'CloseSocket'
-- request to /B/ and records that its connection to /B/ is closing. If /A/
-- receives a new connection request from /B/ after having sent the
-- 'CloseSocket' request it simply forgets that it sent a 'CloseSocket' request
-- and increments the reference count of the connection again.
--
-- When /B/ receives a 'CloseSocket' message and it too is ready to close the
-- connection, it will respond with a reciprocal 'CloseSocket' request to /A/
-- and then actually close the socket. /A/ meanwhile will not send any more
-- requests to /B/ after having sent a 'CloseSocket' request, and will actually
-- close its end of the socket only when receiving the 'CloseSocket' message
-- from /B/. (Since /A/ recorded that its connection to /B/ is in closing state
-- after sending a 'CloseSocket' request to /B/, it knows not to reciprocate /B/
-- reciprocal 'CloseSocket' message.)
--
-- If there is a concurrent thread in /A/ waiting to connect to /B/ after /A/
-- has sent a 'CloseSocket' request then this thread will block until /A/ knows
-- whether to reuse the old socket (if /B/ sends a new connection request
-- instead of acknowledging the 'CloseSocket') or to set up a new socket.

-- * For the case of "valid" we use third data structure to give more details
--   about the state (ValidTransportState, ValidLocalEndPointState,
--   ValidRemoteEndPointState).

-- REMOTE ENDPOINTS

--            |

--            \-------+----------+--------> Failed
--
-- Init: There are two places where we create new remote endpoints: in
--   createConnectionTo (in response to an API 'connect' call) and in
--   handleConnectionRequest (when a remote node tries to connect to us).
--   'Init' carries an MVar () 'resolved' which concurrent threads can use to
--   wait for the remote endpoint to finish initialization. We record who
--   requested the connection (the local endpoint or the remote endpoint).
--
-- Invalid: We put the remote endpoint in invalid state only during
--   createConnectionTo when we fail to connect.
--
-- Valid: This is the "normal" state for a working remote endpoint.
--
-- Closing: When we detect that a remote endpoint is no longer used, we send a
--   CloseSocket request across the connection and put the remote endpoint in
--   closing state. As with Init, 'Closing' carries an MVar () 'resolved' which
--   concurrent threads can use to wait for the remote endpoint to either be
--   closed fully (if the communication parnet responds with another
--   CloseSocket) or be put back in 'Valid' state if the remote endpoint denies
--   the request.
--
--   We also put the endpoint in Closed state, directly from Init, if we our
--   outbound connection request crossed an inbound connection request and we
--   decide to keep the inbound (i.e., the remote endpoint sent us a
--   ConnectionRequestCrossed message).
--
-- Closed: The endpoint is put in Closed state after a successful garbage
--   collection.
--
-- Failed: If the connection to the remote endpoint is lost, or the local
-- endpoint (or the whole transport) is closed manually, the remote endpoint is
-- put in Failed state, and we record the reason.
--
-- Invariants for dealing with remote endpoints:
--
-- INV-SEND: Whenever we send data the remote endpoint must be locked (to avoid
--   interleaving bits of payload).
--
-- INV-CLOSE: Local endpoints should never point to remote endpoint in closed
--   state.  Whenever we put an endpoint in Closed state we remove that
--   endpoint from localConnections first, so that if a concurrent thread reads
--   the MVar, finds RemoteEndPointClosed, and then looks up the endpoint in
--   localConnections it is guaranteed to either find a different remote
--   endpoint, or else none at all (if we don't insist in this order some
--   threads might start spinning).
--
-- INV-RESOLVE: We should only signal on 'resolved' while the remote endpoint is
--   locked, and the remote endpoint must be in Valid or Closed state once
--   unlocked. This guarantees that there will not be two threads attempting to
--   both signal on 'resolved'.
--
-- INV-LOST: If a send or recv fails, or a socket is closed unexpectedly, we
--   first put the remote endpoint in Closed state, and then send a
--   EventConnectionLost event. This guarantees that we only send this event
--   once.
--
-- INV-CLOSING: An endpoint in closing state is for all intents and purposes
--   closed; that is, we shouldn't do any 'send's on it (although 'recv' is
--   acceptable, of course -- as we are waiting for the remote endpoint to
--   confirm or deny the request).
--
-- INV-LOCK-ORDER: Remote endpoint must be locked before their local endpoints.
--   In other words: it is okay to call modifyMVar on a local endpoint inside a
--   modifyMVar on a remote endpoint, but not the other way around. In
--   particular, it is okay to call removeRemoteEndPoint inside
--   modifyRemoteState.
